# Task 2 – Phishing Email Analysis

## Objective
Analyze a sample phishing email to identify and report key indicators of phishing such as spoofed sender addresses, misleading links, grammar issues, and social engineering tactics.

---

## Tools Used
- Text editor (for viewing sample email)
- Free Online Header Analyzer:
  - https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx
  - https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/
- Web browser (for verifying links/domains)

---

## Steps Followed

### Step 1: Obtained a Sample Phishing Email
- Used publicly available phishing sample from [PhishTank](https://www.phishtank.com/) / [Spam Archive] or mock email text.

### Step 2: Analyzed Sender Email
- Checked the "From" address for signs of spoofing 

### Step 3: Examined Email Header
- Used an online header analyzer to trace the origin and check for IP/domain mismatches.

### Step 4: Hovered Over Links
- Identified mismatched URLs by hovering to reveal the actual destination (e.g., link says `https://paypal.com` but goes to `http://paypallogin.ru`)

### Step 5: Looked for Threatening or Urgent Language
- Example: “Your account will be suspended unless you verify within 24 hours!”

### Step 6: Checked for Grammar and Spelling Errors
- Found multiple basic English errors — a common sign of phishing.

### Step 7: Checked for Suspicious Attachments
- Flagged `.zip`, `.exe`, or macro-enabled `.doc` files
