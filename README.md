# phishing--task2
Objective
To identify and document common phishing traits in suspicious emails using manual inspection and online tools.

#Steps to Analyze a Phishing Email
Get a Sample Email
Use public sources like PhishTank or spam archives (do not use personal emails).

Check Sender’s Address
Look for spoofed domains (e.g., support@paypa1.com instead of paypal.com).

Analyze Email Headers
Use tools like MXToolbox to check for SPF/DKIM/DMARC failures.

Inspect Links & Attachments
Hover over links (don’t click) and check if the real URL is suspicious or mismatched.

Identify Urgent or Threatening Language
Look for scare tactics like “account will be suspended” or “verify now”.

Look for Mismatched URLs
Displayed links vs actual URLs should match — phishing emails often disguise bad links.

Check for Grammar/Spelling Errors
Typos and poor grammar are red flags.

Summarize Your Findings
List all phishing traits found in a simple table or checklist.
